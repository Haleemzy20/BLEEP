**Anti-Asset Loss**
A protocol-level mechanism in `bleep-core` allowing asset owners to submit ZKP-backed recovery requests that are approved via governance quorum.

**AnomalyDetector**
An AI-backed fraud detection component that monitors on-chain and off-chain activity patterns for suspicious behaviour.
